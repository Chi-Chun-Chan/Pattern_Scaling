# Pattern_Scaling
Repository containing the work done during the IPLS studentship at the Francis Crick Institute. This project was supervised by Dr Zena Hadjivasiliou and involved numerically solving reaction-diffusion chemical master equations to investigate scaling properties and relationships within a simple morphogen-induced pattern in 1D.
